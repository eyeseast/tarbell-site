Crime and Punishment in Chicago is an index of data sources surrounding this criminal justice system as it is in Chicago. We track data sources from the commission of the crime all the way to prison. We aggregate sources of data, provide insight into how this data is generated, discuss how to get it, and expose what data is unavailable.
