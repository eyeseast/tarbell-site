Frontline built a database for ongoing reporting on changes to voting rights laws after *Shelby v. Holder*. The site tracks how states changed laws affecting early voting, absentee ballots, felons' rights and Voter ID. It is Frontline's first [structured journalism][sj] project and a major digital initiative.
